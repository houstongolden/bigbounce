## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

**1. Theoretical Framework**

- **No full UV completion**: We treat $(\alpha/M)$ phenomenologically. A complete quantum gravity theory might predict its value from first principles.

- **Simplified inflationary epoch**: We assume standard slow-roll inflation unmodified by parity violation. Non-minimal couplings during inflation could alter predictions.

- **Perturbative treatment**: Loop corrections calculated at one-loop. Higher loops might contribute at the 10-20% level.

- **Black hole interior approximation**: Detailed numerical relativity simulations of rotating black hole interiors with quantum corrections remain computationally intractable.

**2. Observational Constraints**

- **Isotropy bounds**: Rotation contributes $< 10^{-20}$ to expansion rate, making it invisible to all distance-based probes. Only parity-odd observables can detect rotation.

- **Limited spiral galaxy samples**: Current samples of $\sim 10^6$ galaxies limit precision. Statistical errors dominate over systematics.

- **CMB polarization systematics**: Despite excellent control, residual systematics approach the predicted signal level.

- **Redshift coverage**: Galaxy spin measurements sparse at $z > 2$, limiting evolutionary constraints.

**3. Systematic Uncertainties**

- **Galaxy morphology classification**: 15% of galaxies have ambiguous spiral structure, reducing effective sample size.

- **Selection effects**: Despite hierarchical modeling, unknown selection biases may remain, especially for high-z samples.

- **Astrophysical contamination**: Galactic magnetic fields could produce EB correlations mimicking cosmological signal.

### Open Questions

1. Why is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma \approx 0.2375$?
2. What determines the UV cutoff scale in the loop calculation?
3. How does parity violation affect primordial gravitational waves?
4. Can other parity-odd observables provide independent confirmation?
5. What is the role of quantum corrections during inflation?

These questions define a rich research program connecting quantum gravity, cosmology, and observations over the next decade.
