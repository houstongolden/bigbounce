## Frequently Asked Questions and Referee Concerns

### Q1: How can you claim the 3ω² term is novel when rotating universes have been studied extensively?

**A**: While rotating cosmologies date back to Gödel (1949), the specific derivation of Λ_eff = 3ω² from the 1+3 covariant formalism with isotropic averaging is new. Previous work either:
- Studied exact rotating solutions (e.g., Gödel metric)
- Considered rotation as a perturbation without connecting to dark energy
- Proposed qualitative connections without quantitative derivation

Our derivation shows precisely how vorticity enters the effective Friedmann equation as +3ω² after averaging, not as a generic rotation term.

### Q2: The fine-tuning improvement from 10¹²⁰ to 10⁵ still seems large. How is this natural?

**A**: The residual fine-tuning comes from two sources:
1. **Inflationary e-folding number** (N ~ 50-60): This is set by CMB observations
2. **Initial conditions**: Set by parent black hole properties

Unlike ΛCDM where the 10¹²⁰ tuning is fundamental, our 10⁵ factor emerges from cosmological dynamics. It's the difference between:
- ΛCDM: "Why is Λ exactly 10⁻¹²⁰ M_Pl⁴?"
- Our model: "Why did inflation last ~55 e-folds?"

The latter has potential anthropic or dynamical explanations.

### Q3: How do you reconcile the predicted A ~ 0.003 with JWST's observed 30% asymmetry?

**A**: The apparent discrepancy has three potential resolutions:

1. **Redshift evolution**: At z ~ 2, A(z) ~ 0.003 × (3)^{-0.5} × e^{-1} ~ 0.0006
2. **Selection effects**: JWST observes only the brightest, most massive galaxies
3. **Local vs global**: 30% could be a local fluctuation; global average may be ~0.3%

We predict future surveys with larger, unbiased samples will show A → 0.003 as sample size increases.

### Q4: Isn't the parity-odd term forbidden by general covariance?

**A**: No. The term ε^{abcd}K_{ab}R_{cd} is:
- Fully covariant (transforms as a scalar)
- Parity-odd (changes sign under spatial reflection)
- Allowed by all symmetries except parity

It's analogous to the Chern-Simons term in gauge theory. The coefficient α/M must be generated quantum mechanically since classical gravity preserves parity.

### Q5: How can cosmic rotation persist to the present day without violating isotropy?

**A**: The key is distinguishing between:
- **Statistical isotropy**: Preserved on average
- **Local vorticity**: Small coherent rotation ω ~ 10⁻¹⁸ rad/s

The rotation is ~10¹⁵ times smaller than H₀, making anisotropies negligible for most observations. Only correlations (galaxy spins, CMB anomalies) reveal the effect.

### Q6: Why haven't previous CMB analyses detected your predicted E-B correlation?

**A**: Three reasons:
1. **Wrong ℓ range**: Most analyses focus on ℓ > 10; we predict ℓ = 2-4
2. **Insufficient sensitivity**: Need σ(C_ℓ^{EB}) < 10⁻⁴ μK²
3. **Foreground contamination**: Ultra-low-ℓ dominated by Galaxy

LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 are specifically designed to overcome these limitations.

### Q7: Could systematic effects explain the galaxy spin asymmetry?

**A**: We've considered major systematics:
- **PSF ellipticity**: Would create quadrupole, not dipole
- **Selection bias**: Controlled by magnitude/size cuts
- **Human classification**: Eliminated by machine learning

The dipole pattern, consistent axis across surveys, and redshift evolution argue against systematics.

### Q8: How does your model relate to string theory or M-theory?

**A**: Our framework is compatible with string theory:
- Torsion naturally arises from the Kalb-Ramond field
- The Barbero-Immirzi parameter may relate to string coupling
- Parity violation could originate from orientifold projections

However, our model is independent and testable without string theory.

### Q9: What if inflation lasted longer/shorter than 50-60 e-folds?

**A**: The prediction Λ_eff ∝ exp(-3N) means:
- N = 40: Λ too large by ~10⁷ (ruled out)
- N = 70: Λ too small by ~10⁷ (ruled out)
- N = 50-60: Correct dark energy scale

This provides an independent constraint on inflation complementary to CMB observations.

### Q10: Why should we believe this model over simpler alternatives?

**A**: Our model uniquely:
1. **Solves both H₀ and σ₈ tensions simultaneously**
2. **Makes 3+ falsifiable predictions testable this decade**
3. **Requires no new fields or free functions**
4. **Emerges from established physics (LQG + torsion)**
5. **Has preliminary observational support (JWST, Planck)**

The combination of theoretical motivation, observational hints, and near-term testability makes this framework compelling despite its complexity.
