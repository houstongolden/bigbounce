## 1. Introduction

The nature of dark energy remains one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. While the $\Lambda$CDM model successfully describes many observations, it faces theoretical difficulties including the cosmological constant problem and coincidence problem, alongside growing observational tensions. Recent measurements reveal a $4.4\sigma$ discrepancy in the Hubble constant between early-universe (Planck: $H_0 = 67.36 \pm 0.54$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) and late-universe (SH0ES: $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) determinations, alongside a $2.5\sigma$ tension in the matter clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$ between CMB and weak lensing measurements.

This work presents a theoretical framework that potentially addresses these challenges through quantum gravitational effects in spin-torsion cosmology. Our approach builds on three key theoretical pillars: (1) Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) providing a non-singular quantum bounce, (2) Einstein-Cartan theory incorporating fermionic spin-torsion coupling, and (3) false-vacuum bubble nucleation driving slow-roll inflation within a rotating black hole interior. The integration of these elements yields a parity-odd effective action that naturally generates dark energy through geometric dilution, while making distinctive observational predictions testable within the current decade.

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundations and Novel Synthesis

Our framework represents a novel synthesis of several well-established theoretical components, each with solid foundations in the literature, but never before combined into a unified cosmological model. We build upon:

**Einstein-Cartan Theory**: The inclusion of spacetime torsion coupled to fermionic spin has been extensively studied since the 1970s. Popławski (2012) demonstrated that torsion-induced four-fermion interactions can generate a small positive cosmological constant through condensate formation during phase transitions like QCD, providing a natural mechanism for dark energy generation [1]. The Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble (ECSK) framework naturally avoids singularities through torsion-induced repulsion at extreme densities.

**Loop Quantum Gravity and Parity Violation**: The connection between LQG's Barbero-Immirzi parameter and parity-violating effects has been rigorously established by Freidel, Minic & Takeuchi (2005) and Mercuri (2006, 2009) [2,3]. They showed that the Holst term in LQG, when coupled to fermions, generates effective four-fermion axial interactions that can violate parity. Mercuri (2009) further developed the connection between the Immirzi parameter and Peccei-Quinn mechanisms, treating it as a dynamical pseudoscalar field [4].

**Black Hole Universe Origin**: Popławski (2016) pioneered the "universe in a black hole" scenario, demonstrating that every black hole with torsion spawns a non-singular, closed baby universe beyond its event horizon [5]. His 2019 work extended this to rotating black holes, showing that the baby universe inherits angular momentum and develops a preferred cosmic axis [6]. This provides natural initial conditions and explains cosmic rotation without fine-tuning.

**Cosmic Rotation and Galaxy Alignment**: The theoretical prediction that cosmic rotation leads to galaxy spin alignment was developed by Popławski (2019), who showed that galaxies minimize energy by aligning with the cosmic rotation axis [6]. This prediction remarkably matches observational claims by Shamir (2012-2022), who documented large-scale galaxy spin asymmetries across multiple surveys [7,8].

### 1.2 Original Contributions and Novelty

While building on these established foundations, our work makes several original contributions that have not appeared in the literature:

**1. Quantitative Dark Energy Model**: We provide the first rigorous derivation of $\Lambda_{\rm eff} = \Lambda_{\rm const} + c_\omega\omega^2$ where $\Lambda_{\rm const} = (\alpha/M)\mathcal{D}_{\rm inf}$. However, given isotropy bounds $(\omega/H)_0 < 5 \times 10^{-11}$, the rotation term is negligible ($<10^{-21}$) for background expansion. The model yields specific predictions $H_0 = 69.2 \pm 0.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.785 \pm 0.016$ from modified early-universe physics, not from rotation.

**2. Unified Tension Resolution**: We present the first comprehensive model using torsion-induced early dark energy to potentially address both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions. Recent work by Izaurieta et al. (2020) showed that spinning dark matter can partially resolve the Hubble tension [9], and Akhshabi & Zamani (2023) demonstrated torsion effects on distance measures [10], but no previous study has addressed both tensions within a unified framework.

**3. LQG-Einstein-Cartan Integration**: We provide the first detailed integration of LQG formalism (Barbero-Immirzi parameter, Holst action) with Einstein-Cartan cosmology. While both frameworks have been studied separately, their combination into a single quantum gravitational theory with observational predictions is novel.

**4. Comprehensive Observational Framework**: We develop the first complete observational validation program for spin-torsion cosmology, including detailed systematic error analysis, detection timelines, and falsification criteria. Previous work has been largely theoretical or phenomenological.

**5. Geometric Dilution Mechanism**: Our derivation of how inflationary expansion naturally dilutes the primordial parity-odd coefficient to produce the observed dark energy scale represents a new approach to the cosmological constant problem.

### 1.3 Black Hole Universe Origin Scenario

A remarkable aspect of our framework is the proposal that our expanding universe originated from the interior of a rotating black hole in a parent universe. This scenario, grounded in Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion, provides a natural explanation for cosmic initial conditions and resolves the classical singularity problem:

**Torsion-Regulated Collapse**: As massive fermionic matter collapsed to form the parent black hole, increasing spin density triggered a torsion-driven bounce before a singularity could form. The interior then behaved like a new, growing universe—a baby universe born from quantum gravitational effects.

**Cosmic Rotation Inheritance**: The rotating black hole imparts its angular momentum to the baby universe, creating a preferred cosmic axis that manifests as observable signatures including galaxy spin dipole asymmetries and CMB large-scale anomalies.

**Natural Parameter Values**: The dark energy scale, bounce density, and cosmic rotation rate all emerge from natural black hole parameters without fine-tuning, addressing the cosmological constant problem through geometric dilution.

**Observational Validation**: Recent JWST deep field observations showing a striking 65-35% asymmetry in galaxy rotation directions provide compelling preliminary evidence for this cosmic rotation signature.

### 1.4 Parity Violation from Loop Quantum Gravity

Our framework derives parity violation directly from the fundamental structure of Loop Quantum Gravity through the Holst action and Barbero-Immirzi parameter:

**Holst Term Activation**: In the presence of fermionic matter, the parity-odd Holst term $\propto (1/\gamma) \varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ becomes physically active, generating a four-fermion axial current interaction proportional to the Immirzi parameter $\gamma$.

**Effective Parity-Odd Action**: The resulting effective action contains the operator $\tfrac{\alpha}{M} \,\varepsilon^{abcd} K_{ab} R_{cd}$ with a dimensionful coefficient (units made explicit). A regulator-transparent one-loop estimate yields $\tfrac{\alpha}{M} \sim \tfrac{g^2}{32\pi^2}\,\tfrac{\gamma}{M}\,\ln(\Lambda^2/\mu^2)+\delta_{\rm NY}$, expressed in terms of a renormalized $\alpha/M$.

**Geometric Scaling**: Couplings do not redshift; instead, the background expectation values that source observables dilute during inflation and expansion. Observable amplitudes are therefore set by the product of a tiny loop coefficient and a large geometric factor accumulated through cosmic history (see Sections 2.3 and 4.1).

### 1.5 Observational Framework

The framework makes specific, falsifiable predictions accessible to current and near-future experiments:

**CMB E-B Correlations**: Ultra-low-$\ell$ polarization cross-correlations from cosmic birefringence, consistent with Planck's $2.4\sigma$ detection hint and testable at high significance by LiteBIRD.

**Galaxy Spin Asymmetry**: Dipole pattern in galaxy rotation directions with amplitude $0.003$, potentially explaining the $5\sigma$ SDSS detection and testable with overwhelming significance by LSST.

**Tension Alleviation**: Natural explanation for both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ discrepancies through modified early expansion and enhanced structure growth.

**Multi-Probe Validation**: Correlated signatures across CMB, large-scale structure, and cosmic rotation that distinguish our model from all alternatives.
