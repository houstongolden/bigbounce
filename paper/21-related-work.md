## Related Work and Positioning

### Previous Contributions

Our framework builds upon several established theoretical components:

**Black hole bounce and torsion cosmology**: Popławski (2010-2016) demonstrated that Einstein-Cartan theory with torsion prevents singularities inside black holes, leading to bouncing cosmologies. We extend this by incorporating Loop Quantum Gravity corrections.

**Rotation constraints and anisotropy**: Planck Collaboration (2020) and Bianchi model analyses constrain cosmic vorticity to $(\omega/H)_0 < 5 \times 10^{-11}$. We respect these bounds while showing rotation manifests through parity-odd observables.

**Holst/Nieh-Yan parity violation**: Freidel, Minic & Takeuchi (2005) and Mercuri (2006) established the connection between the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and parity violation. We provide a regulator-transparent treatment of the resulting effective action.

**BCS-like dark energy mechanisms**: Previous work on fermion condensates in curved spacetime suggested vacuum energy generation. We connect this to the specific four-fermion interaction from Einstein-Cartan theory.

**CMB E-B correlations and birefringence**: Minami & Komatsu (2020) reported cosmic birefringence at $2.4\sigma$. Our framework provides a microscopic origin for this observation.

**Galaxy spin asymmetry studies**: Shamir (2012-2022) documented systematic galaxy spin asymmetries across multiple surveys. We provide the first quantitative theoretical explanation.

### What's New Here

Our novel contributions include:

1. **LQG-inspired parity-odd EC sector**: First complete derivation of the parity-odd effective action from Loop Quantum Gravity with fermions, including proper regularization and renormalization.

2. **Testable multi-probe program**: Unified framework predicting both CMB E-B correlations and galaxy spin asymmetries from a single microscopic mechanism, with quantitative predictions for detection significance.

3. **Regulator-transparent treatment**: Clear specification of dimensional regularization scheme and renormalization conditions, avoiding ambiguities in previous loop calculations.

4. **Late-time Λ from loop + inflationary dilution**: Dark energy arises from the renormalized parity-odd operator diluted through cosmic history, not from ad-hoc assumptions.

5. **Hierarchical Bayesian analysis**: First application of sophisticated statistical methods to galaxy spin data, properly accounting for survey-specific systematics and selection effects.

This represents a testable synthesis of established components into a novel cosmological framework with specific, falsifiable predictions accessible to current and near-future experiments.
