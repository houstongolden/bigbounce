| Symbol/Name | Definition / Formula | Context | Novelty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spin–torsion coupling constant (\(\Lambda_{\rm eff}\)) | \(\Lambda_{\rm eff} = \Lambda + 3\omega^2\) | Effective cosmological constant including rotational-vorticity contribution. | Substantially Novel |
| Torsion-induced 4-fermion term | \(\mathcal L_{AA} = -\tfrac{3\pi G}{2}\,\tfrac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2+1}\,J_A^2\) | From Einstein–Cartan–Holst theory; axial–axial contact term among fermions. | Established |
| Parity-odd spin–torsion operator | \(\mathcal L_{\text{odd}} = \tfrac{\alpha}{M}\,\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} K_{\mu\nu}{}^{ab} R_{\rho\sigma ab}\) | One-loop term linking torsion and curvature, source of cosmic birefringence/EB correlations. | Novel |
| Alpha × Dilution constant | \(\tfrac{\alpha}{M} \times \mathcal{D}_{\rm inf}\) | Connects loop physics to dark energy scale via inflationary dilution. | Novel |
| Golden Parameter (\(\mathcal{g}\)) | \(\mathcal{g} \equiv \tfrac{\alpha}{M} \times \mathcal{D}_{\rm inf}\) | Concise label for the above constant term in \(\Lambda_{\rm eff}\); predicts observed dark energy scale without fine-tuning. Identical mathematically to \(\alpha/M\) × dilution. | Novel (label only) |
| Spin asymmetry function | \(A(z) \approx 0.003\,(1+z)^{-0.5} e^{-z/2}\) | Predicts handedness asymmetry in galaxy spins vs redshift. | Novel |
| Rotation-energy fraction | \(\Omega_\omega(z)\) | Ratio of vorticity energy density to critical density over time. | Substantially Novel |
| Fine-tuning score | \(\text{Score} = \tfrac{\text{Natural scale}}{\text{Observed value}}\) | Compares tuning in \(\Lambda\)CDM, quintessence, and spin–torsion models. | Substantially Novel |
| Naturalness comparator | — | Table of observed vs natural scales across models. | Novel |
| Combined significance | \(\sigma_{\rm combined} = \sqrt{\sigma_{\rm CMB}^2+\sigma_{\rm galaxy}^2}\) | Combines detection significance from EB & spin-asymmetry signals. | Established |

Cross-references: The Golden Parameter \(\mathcal{g}\) is introduced in the [Discussion](./09a-discussion.md) and used to compactly express the constant term in \(\Lambda_{\rm eff}\).
