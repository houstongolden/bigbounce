## Assumptions and Validity Regime

### Conventions

- **Metric signature**: $(-, +, +, +)$
- **Levi-Civita tensor**: $\varepsilon^{0123} = +1$
- **1+3 covariant definitions**: 
  - Shear magnitude: $\sigma^2 \equiv \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma_{ab}\sigma^{ab}$
  - Vorticity magnitude: $\omega^2 \equiv \tfrac{1}{2}\omega_{ab}\omega^{ab}$
  - See Appendix R for complete kinematic decomposition

### Physical Assumptions

1. **Background spacetime**:
   - Almost-FLRW metric with small perturbations
   - Small vorticity: $\omega/H < 10^{-10}$ (much smaller than observational bound)
   - Small shear: $\sigma/H < 10^{-10}$ at background level
   - Perfect fluid matter at zeroth order

2. **Gravity sector**:
   - Einstein-Cartan theory with Holst modification
   - Real Barbero-Immirzi parameter (unitarity requirement)
   - Torsion determined algebraically by fermion axial current
   - Loop quantum gravity corrections treated perturbatively

3. **Matter sector**:
   - Standard Model fermions minimally coupled to gravity
   - No additional non-minimal couplings
   - Fermion masses negligible during early universe
   - Four-fermion interactions from torsion elimination

### Regime of Validity

**Rotation's role**: Due to stringent isotropy constraints, rotation contributes negligibly to background expansion ($|c_\omega\omega^2|/H_0^2 < 10^{-20}$). Rotation manifests **only** through parity-odd observables:
- CMB E-B correlations (probing $\omega^a$ direction)
- Galaxy spin asymmetries (cumulative tidal effects)
- NOT through $H(z)$ modifications at late times

**Energy scales**: 
- Valid below Planck scale where quantum gravity is perturbative
- Above QCD scale where chiral symmetry is approximate
- Inflationary energy scale provides UV cutoff for loop integrals

**Cosmological epochs**:
- Quantum bounce: Full LQC treatment required
- Post-bounce to reheating: Our framework applies
- Post-inflation: Standard cosmology with parity-odd corrections
- Late universe: Rotation effects only in correlations, not expansion

### Limitations

1. **No full UV completion**: Treat $(\alpha/M)$ phenomenologically pending complete quantum gravity theory
2. **Simplified inflation**: Assume standard slow-roll, not modified by parity violation
3. **Galaxy formation**: Tidal torque theory approximation for spin acquisition
4. **Systematic uncertainties**: Hierarchical model cannot remove all selection biases

These assumptions define a consistent theoretical framework making specific predictions testable by current technology.
