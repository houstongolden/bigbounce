## Abstract

Recent JWST observations reveal a striking 65-35% galaxy spin asymmetry at high redshift, while the Hubble tension has reached 4.4σ and the σ₈ tension 2.5σ—suggesting new physics beyond ΛCDM. We present a theoretical framework where dark energy emerges from quantum gravitational effects in a rotating universe born from a black hole interior. 

Our model combines Loop Quantum Gravity with Einstein-Cartan torsion, deriving dark energy from a parity-violating quantum correction: $\Lambda_{\rm eff} = \Lambda_{\rm const} + c_\omega\omega^2$ where $\Lambda_{\rm const} = (\alpha/M)\mathcal{D}_{\rm inf}$. Given stringent isotropy bounds $(\omega/H)_0 < 5 \times 10^{-11}$, rotation is negligible for expansion but sources parity-odd observables. The model yields $H_0 = 69.2 \pm 0.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.785 \pm 0.016$ from modified early-universe physics, reducing tensions without fine-tuning (10⁵ vs 10¹²⁰).

Key predictions: (1) galaxy spin dipole asymmetry following $A(z) = A_0(1+z)^{-p}e^{-qz}$ with hierarchical Bayesian fits yielding $A_0 \sim 0.003$; (2) ultra-low-ℓ CMB E-B correlations detectable by LiteBIRD; (3) correlated cosmic anomalies from underlying rotation. Combined detection significance reaches 4.2-5.9σ by 2034 (depending on cross-correlation $\rho$), offering robust tests this decade.
