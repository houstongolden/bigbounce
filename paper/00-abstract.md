## Abstract

We present a theoretical framework for dark energy arising from quantum gravitational effects in spin-torsion cosmology, potentially addressing the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions in modern cosmology. Building on Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) and Einstein-Cartan theory, we derive a parity-odd effective action term $\alpha \varepsilon^{abcd} K_{ab} R_{cd}$ that naturally generates a cosmological constant of order $\Lambda \approx (2.3 \text{ meV})^4$ through geometric dilution during a quantum bounce. Our framework proposes that our universe originated from the interior of a rotating black hole in a parent universe, with the spin-torsion bounce providing natural initial conditions and cosmic rotation signatures. The theory makes two distinctive observational predictions: (1) ultra-low-$\ell$ CMB E-B correlations with amplitude $C_\ell^{EB} \approx 2 \times 10^{-4} \mu\text{K}^2$ for $\ell = 2$-$4$, detectable at $2.8\sigma$ by CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD; (2) redshift-dependent galaxy spin asymmetry with amplitude $\approx 0.003$ at $10$ Mpc scales, detectable at $3.2\sigma$ by LSST. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating realistic systematic errors demonstrate combined detection significance of $4.4\sigma$ by 2030, with comprehensive mitigation strategies reducing contamination by 85-95% across all sources. The framework can potentially alleviate both Hubble ($H_0 = 68.1 \pm 0.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) and $\sigma_8$ ($\sigma_8 = 0.823 \pm 0.005$) tensions while providing multiple independent falsification channels through degeneracy-breaking analysis. Recent JWST observations showing a 65-35% galaxy spin asymmetry in deep fields provide compelling preliminary evidence for cosmic parity violation, consistent with our rotating universe model predictions.
