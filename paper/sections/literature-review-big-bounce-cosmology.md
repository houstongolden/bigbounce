# Literature Review: Big Bounce Cosmology

## Key Papers

### 1. Loop Quantum Cosmology (Ashtekar & Singh, 2011)
The big bounce replaces the big bang singularity in loop quantum gravity.

### 2. Cyclic Universe (Steinhardt & Turok, 2002)
Ekpyrotic model: universe cycles through big bounces.

### 3. Bouncing Cosmology (Brandenberger & Peter, 2017)
Comprehensive review of bouncing cosmology models.

## Open Questions
- What happens to entropy across the bounce?
- Can we observationally distinguish bounce from inflation?
- Role of quantum gravity corrections near the bounce
