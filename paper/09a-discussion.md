## Discussion

In our framework, the constant contribution to the effective cosmological constant is not inserted ad hoc, but instead emerges from the interplay between a parity-odd spin–torsion interaction and inflationary dilution. This quantity can be compactly expressed as:

\[
\mathcal{g} \ \equiv \ \frac{\alpha}{M} \times \mathcal{D}_{\rm inf}
\]

where \( \alpha/M \) is the loop coefficient from the one-loop parity-odd torsion term, and \( \mathcal{D}_{\rm inf} \) is the suppression factor from inflation. Substituting into our effective cosmological constant gives:

\[
\Lambda_{\rm eff} = 3\omega^2 + \mathcal{g}
\]

This constant, denoted \(\mathcal{g}\) and referred to here as the Golden Parameter, naturally yields a value on the order of \(10^{-33} \,{\rm eV}^2\), consistent with the observed dark energy scale. Importantly, its value is fixed entirely by early-universe physics, requiring no fine-tuning.

See the entry for the Golden Parameter in the glossary for a compact definition and notation: [Glossary: Golden Parameter](./12-glossary.md#golden-parameter).

*Footnote*: The term “Golden Parameter” is introduced here as a concise label for the product \( \alpha/M \times \mathcal{D}_{\rm inf} \). The name is used sparingly for clarity; mathematically, it is identical to the constant term in our \(\Lambda_{\rm eff}\) expression.
