## Problem Statement

The nature of dark energy remains one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The ΛCDM model faces theoretical difficulties including the cosmological constant problem and coincidence problem, alongside growing observational tensions. Recent measurements reveal a 4.4σ discrepancy in the Hubble constant between early-universe (Planck: H₀ = 67.36 ± 0.54 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹) and late-universe (SH0ES: H₀ = 73.04 ± 1.04 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹) determinations, alongside a 2.5σ tension in the matter clustering amplitude σ₈ between CMB and weak lensing measurements.
