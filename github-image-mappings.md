# GitHub Image URL Mappings

## Image URLs from GitHub Issue Upload

These URLs were generated by uploading images to a GitHub issue. They serve as fallback URLs for the Netlify deployment.

## Usage

These URLs are now used in `index.html` as the primary image sources. The local `public/images/` files remain as backups.

## Notes

- GitHub randomly generates these asset IDs, making them hard to identify
- These URLs are permanent and will work as long as the GitHub issue exists
- Total size uploaded: ~4.4 MB (all images combined)
